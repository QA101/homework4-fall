Programming exercises for Methods:

1. Write a method which takes an input as one number (5) and returns first five even numbers starting from 0.

2. Write a method which takes an input as one number (10) and returns first ten odd
numbers starting from 0.

3. Write a method which takes an input as one number (7) and returns first seven
square numbers starting from 0.

4. Write a method which takes an input as one number and returns the product of
a number.
	

5. Write a method which takes an input as two number (e.g. 2 and 5) and returns swap of numbers (5 and 2)

6. Write a method which takes an input as two number and returns the maximum of the two.

7. Write a method which takes an input as two number and returns the minimum of the two.

8. Write a method which takes an input as one number and returns the factorial of a number.

9. Write a method which takes an input as three number and returns the maximum of the three.

10. Write a method which takes an input as three number and returns the minimum of the three.


Note: output is a set of string so define your output type as “String”

public class Method1 {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		System.out.println(PrintNumber(5));
	}
	
	public static String PrintNumber(int n){
		String Final = “ “;
		for(int i=1;i&lt;=n;i++){
			Final = Final + “ “ + i;
		}

	return Final;
	}
}
